minecraft rcon "cracker"  

it spams rcon connect messages to the server to "attempt" to crack the password by sending all possible permuations of a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and some special characters 

this is no more than a proof of concept i though of when i read about the rcon documentation for minecraft / source engine

\* it tests some passwords twice or trice, i was lazy and didn't bother to make a good permutation thingy

> dont use this, its trash but *i* wont stop you
